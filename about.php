		  <p>Arrange for stable Internet connectivity.
		 Giving examination on Laptop or Desktop is highly recommended.
		Make sure mobile/laptop is fully charged. Power bank for mobile or
		UPS/Inverter for laptop/desktop should be arranged for uninterrupted
		power supply.

		plan with sufficient data pack of internet service provider.
		Login to the portal 10 min before the online examination start time.
		Close all browsers/tabs before starting the online examination.

		your attempt may be considered as malpractice and your exam may get
		terminated.
